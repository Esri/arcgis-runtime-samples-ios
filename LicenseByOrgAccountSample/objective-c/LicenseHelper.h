/** Allows the user license an application by logging into a portal.  This method will:
 - check to see if there is a saved encrypted license string
 - if there is an encrypted license string, it will use that to license the application.
 - if there is no saved encrypted license string, it will prompt the user for credentials and then
 login to the portal
 - once the portal login is completed, it will create the license info and use that to license the core
 
 The completion handler will be called with no error when the portal has successfully loaded and the set
 license info operation returns a 'valid' license result.
 
 The completion handler will be called with an error when:
 - the user cancels the portal login process
 - the user chooses not to trust an untrusted host when logging in via OAuth
 - the portal fails to load
 - the portal loads succesffully, but the set license info operation return an invalid or expired result
 
 This method needs to be called from an existing, visible view controller, since it may need to display
 the AGSOAuthLoginViewController.
 @param portalURL The URL of the portal to use, if there is no saved encrypted license string.
 @param parentVC The parent view controller the login view will be displayed from.
 @param completion The code block to be called when the licensing process is finished.
