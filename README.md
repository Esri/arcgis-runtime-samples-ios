==========================

This repository contains Swift sample code demonstrating the capabilities of [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) and how to use them in your own app. The project that can be opened in Xcode and run on a simulator or a device. Or you can [download the app from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-ios/id1180714771) on your iOS device.

The ```master``` branch of this repository contains samples configured for the latest available version of ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS. For samples configured for older versions of the SDK,  look under the ```Releases``` tab for a specific version.


## Features

* Maps - Open, create, inteact with and save maps
* Layers - Layer types offered by the SDK
* Features - Working with Feature layers
* Edit Data - Adding, deleting and editing features
* Display Information - Displaying graphics, popups and callouts
* Search - Finding an address
* Geometry - Displaying geometries
* Route & Directions - Find a route around barriers and get turn-by-turn directions
* Scenes - Display scenes, 3D symbols, and scene layers

## Requirements

* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) 100.7.0 (or newer)
* [ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit for iOS](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-ios) 100.7.0 (or newer)
* Xcode 11.0 (or newer)

The *ArcGIS Runtime SDK Samples app* has a *Target SDK* version of *12.0*, meaning that it can run on devices with *iOS 12.0* or newer.

## Building samples using installed SDK
1. **Fork** and then **clone** the repository
    > Make sure to use the "recursive" option to ensure you get the **ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit** submodule
    >
    >`git clone --recursive [URL to Git repo]`
    >
    > If you've already cloned the repo without the submodule, you can load the submodule using 
    >
    >`git submodule update --init`
1. **Install** the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS to a central location on your mac as described [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/install.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_D57435A2BEBC4D29AFA3A4CAA722506A)  
1. **Open** the `arcgis-ios-sdk-samples.xcodeproj` **project** file
1. **Run** the `arcgis-ios-sdk-samples` app target
    > If you get the error message saying _"This Copy Files build phase contains a reference to a missing file 'ArcGISToolkit.framework'"_, you probably didn't clone the repo to include it's submodule. See Step 1 above.

## Building samples with cocoapods
1. **Fork** and then **clone** the repository
1. **Install** the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS by running the `pod install` command in the folder where you cloned this repository.
1. **Open** the `arcgis-ios-sdk-samples.xcworkspace` **workspace** file
1. **Select** the `arcgis-ios-sdk-samples` project node, go to the `Build Phases` tab, and **delete** the phases for `Embed Frameworks` and `Strip Frameworks` (these phases conflict with cocoapods  and are only required when using the installed SDK as described in the previous section )
1. **Select** the `ArcGISToolkit.xcodeproj` project node and **delete** it. (this project dependency conflicts with cocoapods and is only required when using the installed SDK as described in the previous section)
1. **Run** the `arcgis-ios-sdk-samples` app target


## Sample Data

Some sample data is too large to store in the repository, so it is automatically downloaded at build time. The first time the app is built, a build script downloads the necessary data to `Portal Data`. The script only downloads data files that do not already exist, so subsequent builds will take significantly less time.
