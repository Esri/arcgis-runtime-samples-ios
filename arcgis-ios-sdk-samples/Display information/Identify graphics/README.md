## How it works

It requires the `geoView(_:didTapAtScreenPoint:mapPoint:)` method on `AGSGeoViewTouchDelegate` to know when a user tapped on the map. The method provides a property `mapPoint` which specifies the corresponding touch location in the map. The app then uses the `identify(_:screenPoint:tolerance:returnPopupsOnly:maximumResults:completion:)` method on `AGSMapView` to identify graphics at that particular touch location.
