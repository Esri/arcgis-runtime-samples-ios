## How it works

For creating a picture marker symbol using remote image, the sample uses the `init(url:)` initializer on `AGSPictureMarkerSymbol`, passing the URL for the image as the argument. For creating a picture marker symbol using an image in assets, it uses the `init(image:)` initializer. For which it creates a `UIImage` using the name of the image and passes that as an argument to the initializer.
