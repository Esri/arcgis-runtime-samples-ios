## Use case

Callouts are used to display temporary detail content on a map. You can display text and arbitrary UI controls in callouts.

## How to use the sample

Tap anywhere on the map. A callout showing the WGS84 coordinates for the tapped point will appear. Tap again to hide it.

## How it works

1. Use `AGSGeoViewTouchDelegate.geoView(_:didTapAtScreenPoint:mapPoint:)` to get the `mapPoint` where a user tapped on the map.
2. Create a string to display the coordinates; note that latitude and longitude in WGS84 map to the Y and X coordinates.
3. Create a new callout definition using a title string as `title` and the coordinate string as `detail`.
4. Display the callout by calling `AGSCallout.show(at:screenOffset:rotateOffsetWithMap:animated:)` on the map view with the location and the callout definition.
