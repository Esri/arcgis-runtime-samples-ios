## Use case

Feature services are useful for sharing vector GIS data with clients so that individual features can be queried, displayed, and edited. There are various online and offline methods to load feature services. Feature layers, like all layers, are visual representations of data and are used on a map. In the case of feature layers, the underlying data is held in a feature table or feature service.

## How to use the sample

Tap the button on the toolbar to add feature layers, from different sources, to the map. Pan and zoom the map to view the feature layers.

## How it works

1. Set the basemap with an `AGSBasemapStyle`.
2. Load a feature layer with a URL.  
    i. Create an `AGSServiceFeatureTable` from a URL.  
    ii. Create an `AGSFeatureLayer` with the feature table.  
3. Load a feature layer with a portal item.  
    i. Create an `AGSPortalItem` with the portal and item ID.  
    ii. Create an `AGSFeatureLayer` with the portal item and layer ID.  
4. Load a feature layer with a geodatabase.  
    i. Instantiate and load an `AGSGeodatabase` using the file name.  
    ii. Get the feature table from the geodatabase with the feature table's name.  
    iii. Create an `AGSFeatureLayer` from the feature table.  
5. Load a feature layer with a geopackage.  
    i. Instantiate and load a geopackage using its file name.  
    ii. Get the first `AGSGeoPackageFeatureTable` from the `geoPackageFeatureTables` array.  
    iii. Create an `AGSFeatureLayer` from the feature table.  
6. Load a feature layer with a shapefile.  
    i. Create an `AGSShapefileFeatureTable` using the shapefile name.  
    ii. Create an `AGSFeatureLayer` from the feature table and load it.  
7. Add the feature layer to the map's `operationalLayers`.
