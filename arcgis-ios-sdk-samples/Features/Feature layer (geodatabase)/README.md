# Feature layer (geodatabase)

This sample demonstrates how to show a feature layer on a map using a geodatabase

## How it works

The sample creates an instance of `AGSGeodatabase` using the initializer `init(name:)` where the name refers to a geodatabase file that has been included in the application bundle. The geodatabase is loaded and, upon completion, the TrailHeads feature table is used to create a feature layer that is added to the list of operational layers of the map.
