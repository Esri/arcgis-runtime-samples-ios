# Feature layer query

This sample demonstrates how to query a feature layer via feature table.

## How to use the sample

The sample provides a search bar on the top, where you can input the name of a US State. When you hit search the app performs a query on the feature table and based on the result either highlights the state geometry or provides an error.

Note: The search is case sensitive.

## How it works

When you hit the search button, the sample creates an `AGSQueryParameter` object and specifies the `whereClause` on it, using the text you provided. It then fires the query on the feature table using the `queryFeatures(with:completion:)` method. In the completion block it gets back an `AGSFeatureQueryResult`. Checking the enumerator, if it finds a feature then it highlights the geometry by using `selectFeatures` method on feature layer.
