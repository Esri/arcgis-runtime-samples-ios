# Feature layer selection

Select features in a feature layer.

## Use case

Selecting features, whether by query or identify, can be an important step both in editing data and in visualizing results. One possible use case would be to query a feature layer containing street furniture. A query might look for type "bench" and return a list of bench features contained in the features with an attribute of type bench. These might be selected for further editing or may just be highlighted visually.

## How to use the sample

Tap on a feature in the map. All features within a given tolerance (in pixels) of the tap will be selected.

## How it works

1. Create an `AGSServiceFeatureTable` from a feature service URL.
2. Create an `AGSFeatureLayer` from the service feature table.
3. Identify nearby features at the tapped location using the `AGSGeoView.identifyLayer(_:screenPoint:tolerance:returnPopupsOnly:maximumResults:completion:)` method on the map view.
4. Select all identified features in the feature layer with `AGSFeatureLayer.select(_:)`.
