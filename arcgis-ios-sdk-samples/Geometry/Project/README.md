#Project
Project a point to another spatial reference.

Being able to project between spatial references is fundamental to a GIS. An example of when you would need to re-project data is if you had data in two different spatial references, but wanted to perform an intersect analysis with the AGSGeometryEngine.Intersection function. This function takes two geometries as parameters, and both geometries must be in the same spatial reference. If they are not, you could first use AGSGeometryEngine.project to convert the geometries so they match.

##How to use the sample
Click anywhere on the map. A callout will display the clicked location's coordinate in the original (basemap's) spatial reference and in the projected spatial reference.

##How it works
To project a geometry to another spatial reference: Use the AGSGeometryEngine.projectGeometry function, passing in the chosen coordinates to find the spatial reference coordinates.
