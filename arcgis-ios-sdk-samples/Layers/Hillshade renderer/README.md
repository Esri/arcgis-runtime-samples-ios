## How it works

The sample uses `AGSHillshadeRenderer` class to generate hillshade renderers. The settings provided by the user are put in the initializer `init(altitude:azimuth:zFactor:slopeType:pixelSizeFactor:pixelSizePower:outputBitDepth:)` to get a new renderer and the renderer is then set on the raster.
