## How it works

`AGSMapView` has a property called `backgroundGrid` of type `AGSBackgroundGrid`. The background grid lets you customize the background of the map view with the following properties:
- `color` : fill color
- `gridLineColor` : color of background grid lines
- `gridLineWidth` : width (in points) of background grid lines
- `gridSize` : size (in points) of the background grid
