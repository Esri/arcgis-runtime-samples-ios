# Create terrain from a local tile package

Set the terrain surface with elevation described by a local tile package.

![Create terrain from a local tile package](create-terrain-from-a-local-tile-package.png)

## Use case

The terrain surface is what the basemap, operational layers, and graphics are draped on. The tile package must be a LERC (limited error raster compression) encoded TPK. Details on creating these are in the [ArcGIS Pro documentation](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/sharing/overview/tile-package.htm).

Terrain can be loaded offline from tile packages (.tpk).

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISScene` and add it to a `SceneView`.
1. Create an `ArcGISTiledElevationSource` with the path to the local tile package.
1. Add this source to the scene's base surface: ```
surface.elevationSources.append(elevationSource)
scene.baseSurface = surface```.

## Relevant API

- ArcGISTiledElevationSource
- Surface
